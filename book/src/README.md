# Introduction

I have been trying to get to learn a new language. Something that is a bit more "to the metal". For that reason I have been trying to learn Rust. It is a rather new paradigm for me to learn so the curve is pretty steep. But after a while some things just *clicked*. I changed the way I think about programming and gave new insights into how an compiler works and what you need to account for when programming. I know it is different in every programming language but it is could to be aware of what you should take in account when programming.

This is my journey into Rust and things I have learned along the way.
