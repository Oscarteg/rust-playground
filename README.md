# Rust Playground

As I journey through everything to learn about Rust, this is just my own playground to learn things. 

## Resources used

- [Offical Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)

For creating my own Rust Book with notes I use [Rust MDBook](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html). This is paired with a Github Action that deploys the book on Github Pages.
