# Smart pointers
Box is used for storing data on the *heap.*

When to use:

- When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time and you want to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size
- When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but ensure the data won’t be copied when you do so
- When you want to own a value and you care only that it’s a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type

> One type whose size can’t be known at compile time is a ***recursive type***
